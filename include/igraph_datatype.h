/**
 * \ingroup internal
 * \struct igraph_t
 * \brief The internal data structure for storing graphs.
 *
 * It is simple and efficient. It has the following members:
 * - <b>n</b> The number of vertices, reduntant.
 * - <b>directed</b> Whether the graph is directed.
 * - <b>from</b> The first column of the edge list.
 * - <b>to</b> The second column of the edge list.
 * - <b>oi</b> The index of the edge list by the first column. Thus
 *   the first edge according to this order goes from
 *   \c from[oi[0]] to \c to[oi[0]]. The length of
 *   this vector is the same as the number of edges in the graph.
 * - <b>ii</b> The index of the edge list by the second column. 
 *   The length of this vector is the same as the number of edges.
 * - <b>os</b> Contains pointers to the edgelist (\c from
 *   and \c to for every vertex. The first edge \em from
 *   vertex \c v is edge no. \c from[oi[os[v]]] if 
 *   \c os[v]<os[v+1]. If \c os[v]==os[v+1] then
 *   there are no edges \em from node \c v. Its length is
 *   the number of vertices plus one, the last element is always the 
 *   same as the number of edges and is contained only to ease the
 *   queries.
 * - <b>is</b> This is basically the same as <b>os</b>, but this time
 *   for the incoming edges.
 * 
 * For undirected graph, the same edge list is stored, ie. an
 * undirected edge is stored only once, and for checking whether there
 * is an undirected edge from \c v1 to \c v2 one
 * should search for both \c from=v1, \c to=v2 and 
 * \c from=v2, \c to=v1.
 *
 * The storage requirements for a graph with \c |V| vertices
 * and \c |E| edges is \c O(|E|+|V|).
